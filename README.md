# When the Medium Forgets: The Ephemeral Engine

A multi-page digital installation exploring communication technologies with memory loss.

## 🌊 The Experience Flow

1. **Landing Page** (`index.html`) - Introduction to the concept of intentional forgetting
2. **Invitation Page** (`invitation.html`) - Invitation to share a memory for forgetting
3. **Forgetting Page** (`forgetting.html`) - The ritual of watching a memory decay
4. **Archive Page** (`archive.html`) - Records of what was forgotten (not the content itself)
5. **Reflection Page** (`reflection.html`) - Theoretical context and deeper exploration

## ✨ Core Concept

This installation makes experiential the central argument from the research paper *"When the Medium Forgets: A Theory of Communication Technologies With Memory Loss"*:

> Forgetting is not accidental or unfortunate but instead a designed, necessary, and culturally meaningful aspect of the history of communication.

Instead of a website *about* forgetting, this is a system that *performs* forgetting as a digital ritual.

## 🎨 Design Philosophy

- **Poetic over technical** - Emphasizes emotion, ritual, and meaning
- **Single-mode focus** - Deep engagement with text-based forgetting
- **Guided journey** - Users are gently led through a meaningful experience
- **Aesthetic cohesion** - Warm, paper-like colors and serif typography
- **Ethical design** - Privacy-focused; stores only traces, not content

## 🔮 Forgetting Algorithms

Three poetic methods of digital forgetting:

1. **Erosion** - Like sand writing washed away by tide
2. **Burning** - Like a letter set aflame for privacy
3. **Mutation** - Like oral stories changing with each retelling

## 💾 Technical Implementation

Built with:
- **HTML5/CSS3/JavaScript** - Core web technologies
- **LocalStorage API** - For archive persistence (stores only metadata)
- **SessionStorage** - For passing data between pages
- **CSS Animations** - For visual decay effects
- **Web Audio API** - For atmospheric soundscapes

## 🚀 How to Run Locally

### Simple Method:
1. Download all files into one folder
2. Open `index.html` in a modern web browser
3. Follow the guided experience

### For Development:
1. Clone/download all files
2. Structure should be:
   ephemeral-engine/
   ├── index.html # Landing page
   ├── invitation.html # Memory input page
   ├── forgetting.html # Forgetting process page
   ├── archive.html # Archive of traces
   ├── reflection.html # Theoretical context
   ├── style.css # All styles
   ├── script.js # Shared JavaScript
   └── README.md # This file
3. Open with Live Server (VS Code extension) or any local server

### Deploy to GitHub Pages:
1. Push all files to a GitHub repository
2. Go to Settings → Pages → Source: Select "main" branch
3. Your installation will be live at: `https://[username].github.io/[repo-name]/`

## 🧠 Theoretical Foundations

This installation explores:
- Ephemerality as a design principle
- The cultural logic of intentional forgetting
- Technologies of memory loss vs. preservation
- Digital rituals of release and letting go
- The ethics of not remembering

## 📱 Responsive Design

The installation works on:
- Desktop computers (recommended for full experience)
- Tablets
- Mobile phones (with adjusted layouts)

## 🔒 Privacy & Ethics

- **No content storage** - Memories are processed and forgotten
- **Trace-only archive** - Archive stores only metadata, not actual content
- **No tracking** - No analytics, cookies, or user identification
- **Client-side only** - All processing happens in the browser

## 🎯 Learning Outcomes

Through this installation, users experience:
1. The emotional impact of intentional forgetting
2. The difference between forgetting as loss vs. liberation
3. The poetics of digital decay
4. Alternatives to preservation-focused technology

## 📚 Academic Context

Created for: Communication and Technology course
Original paper: "When the Medium Forgets: A Theory of Communication Technologies With Memory Loss"
Concept: Reversing the typical narrative that celebrates preservation technologies

## 🔧 Development Notes

- All forgetting algorithms run client-side
- Archive uses localStorage (clears if browser data is cleared)
- Sound effects are optional and gentle
- No external dependencies beyond Google Fonts and Font Awesome CDN

## 🌟 Features

- Multi-page narrative flow
- Three poetic forgetting algorithms
- Interactive memory decay visualization
- Archive of forgotten traces
- Theoretical reflection section
- Fully responsive design
- Accessible color schemes
- Subtle soundscapes
